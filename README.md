# Anime I Have Seen :) 
Hello! This repository includes the code for an app I made with all the anime I have seen from the website **Crunchyroll** (logo in the top left corner of the deployed app).   
Here is a link to the app for assignment B3: [Anime I Have Seen :)](https://jchalissery14.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-jchalissery14/)   
Here is the link for assignment B4: [UPDATED - Anime I Have Seen :)](https://jchalissery14.shinyapps.io/assignment-b4-jchalissery14/)

Assignment B4 has the updated version of the app, with additional user-friendly features!

This app allows you to filter for whichever genre(s) you are interested in and gives you the title, link to the page, number of episodes, rating, and all the genres the anime belongs to.  
You can arrange the filtered animes according to the number of episodes it has or its rating.   
You can also interact with the table showing the filtered animes by clicking through the pages and using the search bar.  


The dataset used to build this app is included in this repository - it is a modified version of [this dataset](https://github.com/cckuqui/anime-db/blob/master/datasets/crunchyroll.csv)  
I modified it to include only anime I have seen at least one episode of and did some minor quality checks (filled in missing values and rearranged/added/removed columns). 

Enjoy!
