# Anime I Have Seen :)   
Hello! This repository has been updated with a newer version of the app **Anime I Have Seen :)** that has additional user-friendly features! It has all the anime I have seen from the website **Crunchyroll** (logo in the top left corner of the deployed app).  

Here is the link to the previous version: [B3 - Anime I have seen :)](https://jchalissery14.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-jchalissery14/)  

Here is the link to the current version: [B4 - Anime I Have Seen :)](https://jchalissery14.shinyapps.io/assignment-b4-jchalissery14/)

This app allows you to filter for whichever genre(s) you are interested in and gives you the title, link to the page, number of episodes, rating, and all the genres the anime belongs to.  
The additional features allow you to arrange the filtered animes according to the number of episodes it has or its rating.   
You can also interact with the table showing the filtered animes by clicking through the pages and using the search bar.   
*Note that Features 1-3 are from the previous version of the app, and Features 4-6 are from the updated version*

The dataset used to build this app is included in this repository - it is a modified version of [this dataset](https://github.com/cckuqui/anime-db/blob/master/datasets/crunchyroll.csv)  
I modified it to include only anime I have seen at least one episode of and did some minor quality checks (filled in missing values and rearranged/added/removed columns). 

Enjoy!
